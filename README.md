# Bimber Boys Band Official Web Page

See the [demo version](https://bimberboys-official.vercel.app/) deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). You can check the live production version at [Bimber Boys Official](https://bimberboys.pl).

The project is a semi-commercial realisation of a successful cooperation with one of the coolest local folk cover bands in Poland. It is a statically generated landing page written in Next.js, typed with Typescript and styled using Sass with CSS modules.

**Main features**:

- subscribing to the newsletter by typing in an email address.
- user can see the gallery of images with their descriptions on hover/tap.
- user can listen to the band's music samples using a custom audio player
- user can watch the band's video clips using a Youtube player
- sending a message using the contact form

## üíø Installation

The project uses [node ver16.13.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm ver8.1.0](https://www.npmjs.com/).

1. `git fork`
2. `git clone` your repo.
3. `cd` into project root directory
4. `npm i`

Then, you can run:

#### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## ü§î Solutions provided in the project

- Mock pages were designed using Figma prototyping tool:
  &nbsp;
  ![figma mocks](./wireframes/figma/figma-mocks.jpg)
  &nbsp;

- Mogo created in [Canva.com](https://canva.com)
- I built a custom audio player using React hooks: `useRef`, `useState` and `useEffect`, which were used to wire up the HTML `audio` Element. The global player state (the current audio track and setters for previous and next track) was based on Context API, and `useContext` hook.
- All images are served locally and wrapped in the Next.js's `<Image>` Component, which accounted for an automatic image resize and optimisation, as described in the documentation: [Image Component and Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization)
- The icons used in this project come from [fontawsome.com](https://fontawesome.com/)
- The subscription feature is built using a custom integration with [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) marketing tool via adopting Mailchimp's contact form
- All forms are developed with the use of [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/), with custom error and loading state handlers and form submission.
- Animated logo used at home page was developed using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) library.
- For securing the forms I used [Botpoison](https://botpoison.com/) spam prevention tool, which combines `Hashcash` cryptographic hash-based proof-of-work algorithm, IP reputation checks and sessions and request analyses. No more captcha riddles!

## üí≠ Conclusions

#### Styling Next.js's `<Image>` component

As described in [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization#styling), Next.js wrapper on `img` HTML element has a specific structure you need to take into consideration when applying styles, which may not be as straightforward as it is with simple `img`.
As Peter Lunch nicely explains, the Nextjs Image component nests `img` into couple of other containers. In his [blog post](https://www.peterlunch.com/snippets/next-image-styling), he talks about `div`, but I've got my `img` wrapped into `span`s. So, styling was possible by wrapping `<Image>` into a `div` and then using:

```css
.img_wrapper > span {
  box-shadow: $base-box-shadow;
}
```

Also useful, there's an in-depth explanation on why and how from the creators of the `<Image>` component posted [here](https://web.dev/image-component/).

#### Building and styling a custom audio player in React.js

Now, this was fun... When it comes to styling an audio player and account for different web browsers out there, it is a mess...
Just have a look at one of the CSS classes I used:

```CSS
.progressBar {
  --bar-before-width: 0;
  background: $bar-bg;
  appearance: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 2px;
  outline: none;
}

// progressbar -firefox
.progressBar::moz-range-track {
  background: $bar-bg;
  appearance: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 2px;
  outline: none;
}

.progressBar::-moz-focus-outer {
  border: 0;
}
```

...and it goes on and on with every single piece of the player: from the progressbar through the slider thumb (in Chrome and Safari) or range thumb(in Firefox). Phew...

Now, in implementation of the player logic, there's a bit of a problem with `useEffect` hook, which should update the progress bar on every change of `currentTrackMoment` (every second that is), except that it doesn't. Due to re-render optimisation algorithms of React, `useEffect` updates state asynchronously which makes it useless in this particular scenario. Hence, `requestAnimationFrame()` method was used to update the progress bar on every change of the `currentTrackMoment`.

```JS
const handlePlay = () => {
    const prevValue = isPlaying;
    setIsPlaying(!prevValue);
    if (audioPlayer.current) {
      if (!prevValue) {
        audioPlayer.current.play();
        animationRef.current = requestAnimationFrame(whilePlaying);
      } else {
        audioPlayer.current.pause();
        cancelAnimationFrame(animationRef.current);
      }
    }
  };
```

#### Mailchimp integration

I used [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) for the subscribe feature.
