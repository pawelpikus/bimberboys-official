## ü§î Solutions provided in the project

- mock pages were designed using Figma prototyping tool:
  &nbsp;
  ![figma mocks](./wireframes/figma/figma-mocks.jpg)
  &nbsp;

- logo created in [Canva.com](https://canva.com)
- I built a custom audio player using React hooks: `useRef`, `useState` and `useEffect`, which were used to wire up the HTML `audio` Element. The global player state (the current audio track and setters for previous and next track) was based on Context API, and `useContext` hook.
- all images are served locally and wrapped in the Next.js's `<Image>` Component, which accounted for an automatic image resize and optimisation, as described in the documentation: [Image Component and Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization)
- the icons used in this project come from [fontawsome.com](https://fontawesome.com/)
- the subscription feature is built using a custom integration with [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) marketing tool via adopting Mailchimp's contact form
- all forms are developed with the use of [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/), with custom error and loading state handlers and form submission.
- animated logo used at home page was developed using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) library.
- For securing the forms I used [Botpoison](https://botpoison.com/) spam prevention tool, which combines `Hashcash` cryptographic hash-based proof-of-work algorithm, IP reputation checks and sessions and request analyses. No more captcha riddles!
